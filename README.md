Manual Testing for DesignSpark Graphic Design App

DesignSpark is a web-based graphic design app similar to Canva, allowing users to create designs using templates, upload images, collaborate in real-time, and export designs in various formats (e.g., PNG, PDF). The manual testing project verifies functionality, usability, performance, and security, with all files provided in an unzipped structure.

Graphic Design Focus: Tests specialized features like template customization, drag-and-drop editing, real-time collaboration, and export functionality, tailored to a Canva-like app.
Usability Emphasis: Includes test cases for UI/UX, ensuring a clean, modern, and intuitive interface, aligning with your preference for minimalistic and user-focused design (e.g., portfolio site inspiration).

Comprehensive Files: Provides all necessary files (test cases, test data, setup guide, defect log) in accessible formats, ready for immediate use without zipping.

Edge Cases: Covers unique scenarios like large image uploads, collaboration conflicts, and export failures.
